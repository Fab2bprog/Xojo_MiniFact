It is the structure of billing software, inventory management, product management. It can be used as a basis for developing business-like applications. The software is delivered as is, in its development state.

For beginners exploring the source code of this application : you can learn all the most important notions of programming in xojo:
textbox, listbox, window, treeview, use of the sqlite database ... You will also learn how to manage windows and how to pass values between several windows.

- User rights management: One of the advantages of this code base is that it integrates user management, user groups, read / write rights on the screens.
- Data list windows: They can manage without fear lists of millions of data: because they integrate the notion of pagination.
- Standard data management (customers, suppliers, taxes, measurement units, postal code, products) combining list and input screen.
So much of the basic work no longer needs to be done.
- Management of article nomenclature in TreeView, with an infinite number of levels.
- 46 windows: some fully functional, others that must be fully coded. With regard to the fields present full of ideas you will come to mind to develop an application that meets your needs.
- At item level: management of purchase and sale prices, ean codes. Ability to dynamically create product features by the end user.
- The software contains the description of the database in a dictionary inside the source code.


In short: I made the structure, now develop your software.

Initially developed with realbasic 2011. I save this project with a demo version of Xojo 2019R3. 
The icons folder must be located in the same directory as MiniFact.xojo_binary_project. It contains all the icons necessary to compile the program.
