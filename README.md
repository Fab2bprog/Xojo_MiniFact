This is the beginning of a billing software, inventory management, product management. It can be used as a basis for developing business-type applications. The software is delivered as is, in its state of development.

For beginners exploring the source code of this application : you can learn all the most important notions of programming in xojo:
textbox, listbox, window, treeview, use of the sqlite database ... You will also learn how to manage windows and how to pass values between several windows.

- User rights management: One of the advantages of this code base is that it integrates user management, user groups, read / write rights on the screens.
- Data list windows: They can manage without fear lists of millions of data: because they integrate the notion of pagination.

Initially developed with realbasic 2011. I save this project with a demo version of Xojo 2019R3.

The "icons" folder must be located in the same directory as MiniFact.xojo_binary_project.
It contains all the icons necessary to compile the program.
