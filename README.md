# Xojo_MiniFact

It is several months of development work that I give to the xojo community !!!!!!
I prefer that to leave it in the drawer...
Initially developed with realbasic 2011, I migrated this project under xojo 2019.

This is a very very very advanced example of what you can do with xojo (https://www.xojo.com/)
I save this project with a demo version of Xojo 2019 R3.

By exploring the source code of this application you will be able to learn all of the most important notions of programming in xojo:
textbox, listbox, window, treeview, using of sqlite database ... 

This is the beginning of a billing software, inventory management, product management that I abandoned few years ago. I would very much like someone to finish this development.

The "icons" folder must be located in the same directory as MiniFact.xojo_binary_project.
It contains all the icons necessary to compile the program.

The software is delivered as is, with its bug. We can consider it as a demo how to access database sqlite.

To run Minifact ( it's in french) at the beginning click on the menu:
[Fichier]->[Ouvrir Fichier]
And Select database.rsd
There is no password.


Enjoy.
